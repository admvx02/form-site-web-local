3. Download and Install  [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
   - Basically Docker is based on Linux
4. Open windows PowerShell to update the wsl

```
wsl --update
```

4. Get the code
   - Clone the project
   
```
https://github.com/beranidigital/form-site-web.git
```

5. cd form-site-web
6. Verify your Docker File
   - Open the sample application in your IDE. Note that it already has a Dockerfile. For your own projects you need to create this yourself.
7. Build your firts Image
   - You can build an image using the following docker build command via a CLI in your project folder.
  
```
docker build -t form-site-web .
```

8. Running from docker hub

```
docker run --name opnform -v $PWD/my-opnform-data:/persist -p 80:80 jhumanj/opnform
```

9. Run your container
   - Once the build is complete, an image will appear in the Images tab. Select the image name to see its details. Select Run to run it as a container. In the Optional settings remember to specify a port number (something like 8080)

10. View the Frontend
   - You now have a running container. If you don't have a name for your container, Docker provides one. View your container live by selecting the link below the container's name.
